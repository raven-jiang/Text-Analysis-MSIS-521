# Text-Analysis-MSIS-521

This repository stores my assignments from the graduate curriculum – IT and Digital Marketing (MSIS 521). IA2 and IA3 work with text analysis on restaurant and movie reviews. 

IA2: 
Tokenize each of 100 restaurant and movie review in the collection (nltk), lemmatize all the words, remove all the stop‐words and the punctuations, convert each of the reviews in TD‐IDF vectors, and then POS‐tag each word and do a TD‐IDF vectorization. Finally, export to csv file.

IA3: 
Transform 1000 restaurant and movie reviews into a term‐document matrix, lemmatize all the words, remove the stop‐words and punctuations, then use the LDA model to extract the topics on restaurant and movie reviews. Here are the top topics found and initial analysis conclusion.

Restaurant:
Top-5 terms are:
1)	“eat, price, like, people, restaurant”
2)	“good, eat, another, food, shop, taste”
3)	“pork, baht, delicious, good, quite”
4)	“good, duck, eat, restaurant, like, delicious”
5)	“soup, sweet, buffet, taste, eat”
6)	“hat, people, store, eat, ask”
The review could be describing a quality and cheap restaurant that offers soup, duck, pork and buffet, and is liked by customers.

Movie:
Top-5 terms are:
1)	“ha, like, also, wa, think”
2)	“people, wa, see, also, time”
3)	“like, one, many, also, ha”
4)	“wa, say, lot, ha, good”
5)	“say, ha, always, good, people”
6)	“wa, ha, like, one, white”
The review could be describing a comedy movie that audience shows enthusiasm and reacts to in laughters, explaining “ha”s and “wa”s.
